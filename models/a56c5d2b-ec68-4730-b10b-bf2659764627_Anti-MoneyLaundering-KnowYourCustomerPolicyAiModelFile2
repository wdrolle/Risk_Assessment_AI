could find the same services nearer to home)Business customers who are reluctant to provide complete information regarding the purpose, prior banking relationships, officers or directors, or location of their business.Business customers who are reluctant to reveal details about their activities, or to provide financial statements, or whose financial statements are noticeably different from those of similar businesses.Large cash deposits by an individual or business where checks and other instruments are the expected norm.Structuring multiple cash deposits which are individually unexceptional, but significant in the aggregate.Exchanging large quantities of low denomination currencies for those of higher denomination.Deposit or withdrawal activity that is inconsistent with the activity normally associated with the customer or the customer’s type of business.Funds transfers are sent or received from the same person to or from different accounts.Funds activity is unexplained, repetitive, or shows unusual patterns.A customer uses unusual or suspicious identification documents that cannot be readily verified.The customer’s background differs from that which would be expected on the basis of his or her business activities.A customer is reluctant to provide information needed to file a mandatory report, to have the report filed, or to proceed with a transaction after being informed that the report must be filed.A person uses the automated teller machine to make several bank deposits below a specified threshold.The currency transaction activity reflect a sudden change
