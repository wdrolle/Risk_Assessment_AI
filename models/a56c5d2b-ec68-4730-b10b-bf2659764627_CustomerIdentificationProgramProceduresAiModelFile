As such, these CIP Procedures describe:Identifying information that is obtained from every customer opening a new accountTechnology utilized to verify identifying information provided by a customer in the course of opening an iCW accountActions taken by iCW in the event that the Company is unable to form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customerRecords created and maintained by iCW with respect to its CIPGovernment lists utilized at onboardingCustomer notice of iCW’s efforts to collect and maintain records related to the CIPScopeThese Procedures govern all aspects of iCW’s CIP, and they are applicable to all personnel at iCW, including both employees and consultants. It is also applicable to all third parties with whom iCW has business arrangements for ongoing operational activities. Third parties include, but are not limited to, dental office partnerships, bank partnerships, and service providers.Related Documents and governing lawPolicies and Procedures:BSA/AML and OFAC PolicyCompliance Management System PolicyWatchlist Screening ProceduresData Handling and Retention PolicyGoverning Law:31 CFR § 1020.220CUSTOMER INFORMATION REQUIREDiCW’s CIP is fundamental in preventing the Company from becoming involved in money laundering, terrorist financing, or sanctions violations. In the course of onboarding a customer, iCW collects the following data: NameFirst nameLast nameAddressStreet addressCityStateZip CodeIdentification NumberSocial Security Number (SSN)Date of BirthDate of birthThe Company will never open an account for customers who:Are corporations or other entities;Give only a Post Office Box as an address;Give a foreign address;Do not provide each of the required pieces of information described above;IDENTITY VERIFICATIONiCW primarily employs non-documentary methodologies for verifying identifying details input by loan applicants, which consists of comparing applicant data with information obtained via a consumer reporting agency (TransUnion).TransUnion specifically evaluates identity verification risk via analyzing applicant inputs (first name, last name, address, SSN, and date of birth) against multiple data sources and produces an output risk score for each applicant (pass, flag, or fail).If an applicant’s TransUnion risk output is  “pass”, no serious identification red flags were uncovered, and the application will continue along a standard underwriting and processing path.If an applicant’s risk output is “flag” based on a CIP-relevant datapoint, they will be asked to provide an answer to a knowledge-based authentication (KBA) question and prompted for additional verification documents to remediate the specific flag condition(s). The only instance in which a KBA alone may serve to verify a portion of the applicant’s identity are for instances when the specific flag condition generated is regarding the applicant’s address. All other flag conditions (name, SSN, and DOB) must be remedied with documentary evidence. If the additional verification is not received or does not validate the flag condition, the customer must be declined. The table below lists acceptable documents to remediate specific flag conditions.Flag ConditionAcceptable Remediation DocumentsFirst and/or Last NameUnexpired driver’s licenseUnexpired military IDUnexpired passportUnexpired state IDBirth certificateMarriage certificateSocial Security cardCourt decree of a legal name changeAddressUnexpired driver’s licenseUnexpired state IDUtility bill*Mobile phone bill*Pay stub*W-2 from the year immediately prior1099 from the year immediately priorCurrent rental agreement or mortgage statementProperty deedBank statement*SSNSocial Security cardW-2 form1099 formFederal tax transcriptPay stub if it lists a SSNDate of BirthDriver’s licenseState IDPassport*Document must be dated within 60 days of the application date. Finally, TransUnion may have a risk output of “fail”. In this instance, the loan application cannot proceed until the applicant remediates the matter directly with the credit bureau.The nature of a mobile lending platform is such that applicants will not appear in person in a traditional brick and mortar financial institution. Due to this, applicants are also required to upload either a driver’s license, state ID, Military ID, or Passport into the App. The photo identification provided is then matched to the individual making the loan application either by utilizing facial recognition software via a “selfie” or by prompting them to correctly answer a KBA question. If the applicant has previously correctly answered a KBA question, the photo identification will be accepted without the need to do so again.If the applicant is unable to pass verification, iCW will not form a customer relationship with the applicant. RECORDKEEPINGiCW retains all CIP information for a minimum five (5) years after the date the account was closed, in a manner consistent with the iCW Data Handling and Retention Policy. CIP records are retained on a secure Amazon Webservice database (Database).Information retained in the Database must include – Customer name; date of birth; and physical addressCustomer SSNWhether the photo identification produced is a passport, military ID or state driver’s license/state IDWhether the customer has opted to utilize the facial and vocal recognition features of the application (a description of non-documentary methods used to verify the identity of a customer)If applicable, a description of the resolution of any substantive discrepancy discovered when verifying identifying informationCOMPARISON WITH GOVERNMENT LISTSThe Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) requires that all persons and entities in the United States block of freeze property, payment of any funds, transfers, and transactions with anyone on OFAC watchlists. Accordingly, iCW will not fund an account until further investigations reveals that the “hit” on the list is not a legitimate match.To comply with this requirement at onboarding, iCW utilizes TransUnion’s OFAC Name Screen service, which screens consumer information against the following watchlists:Specially Designated Nationals (SDN)Specially Designated Terrorist (SDT)Specially Designated Kingpins (SDNTK)Foreign Sanctions Evaders (FSE)Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO)Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers (SDNT)Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT)TransUnion compares consumer name and date of birth against the aforementioned watchlists for potential matches and generates OFAC alerts if there is an 85 percent degree of matching or greater. What this means is that the matching logic utilized by TransUnion will detect certain misspellings or other incorrectly entered text, and will return near, or proximate matches. This 85 percent threshold is also referred to as a minimum name score.Due Diligence: Given that the minimum name score is placed at 85, if TransUnion’s software detects a possible match, TransUnion will place an OFAC alert on the credit report and remit to Lending Solutions, Inc. (LSI) to determine whether it is a legitimate match.LSI will either disposition a TransUnion OFAC alert as a “true match” or a “false positive” by manually checking the information contained within an OFAC list against information provided by the applicant. Regardless of the outcome, all OFAC alerts dispositioned by LSI must be shared with iCW immediately upon receipt and disposition.In the event that LSI deems the match legitimate, the BSA/AML Manager (or a designee) at iCW will perform further due diligence using LexisNexis and information obtained via iCW’s Customer Identification Program (CIP). If the BSA/AML Manager believes that the individual is on an OFAC list, they must inform WebBank via Salesforce within one (1) business day of receiving the LSI disposition.iCW will investigate all details surrounding the attempt to acquire a loan to ascertain if a Suspicious Activity Report is also required in accordance with the Suspicious Activity and Reporting ProceduresInstances of legitimate list matches are retained for five (5) years for audit and regulatory purposes.CUSTOMER NOTICEThe following notice regarding CIP is embedded with the iCW application, which is available for customer review prior to officially opening an account:In accordance with Section 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act signed October 26, 2001, all financial institutions are mandated to implement a Customer Identification Program (CIP) as a tool to protect the U.S. financial system from money laundering, terrorist financing, identity theft and other forms of fraud. iCreditWorks is required to: *Obtain customer identifying information from each customer prior to account opening and in identifying signatory individuals added to an existing or new account. *Maintain records of the information used to verify the person’s identity including name, address and other identifying means.
